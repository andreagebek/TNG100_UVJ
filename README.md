# The mass-dependent UVJ diagram at cosmic noon

This repository contains the datasets and analysis notebook
needed to reproduce the results from our study of the UVJ
diagram with TNG100 (submitted to A&A). All you need to do is
run the main.ipynb jupyter notebook!

Note that the SIMBA data is not included in this repository as the
data products generated for SIMBA from Akins et al. 2022 are not
publicly available. In case you would like to have access to them
reach out to andrea.gebek@ugent.be!
