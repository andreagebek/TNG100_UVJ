# The mass-dependent UVJ diagram at cosmic noon

This repository contains the datasets and analysis notebook
needed to reproduce the results from our study of the UVJ
diagram with TNG100 (published in A&A, [Gebek et al. 2025](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025A%26A...695A..90G/abstract)). All you need to do is
run the main.ipynb jupyter notebook!

Note that the SIMBA data is not included in this repository as the
data products generated for SIMBA from [Akins et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...929...94A/abstract) are not
publicly available. In case you would like to have access to them
reach out to andrea.gebek@ugent.be!
